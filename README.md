<br>

# **_Situation:_**

- Portfolio optimization is crucial for investors aiming to maximize returns while minimizing risk. The challenge is to analyze a vast amount of data from different commodities and create an optimal portfolio mix.
- The dataset comprises historical commodity prices and key financial metrics over several years, requiring meticulous data processing and analysis.

# **_Task:_**

- Develop an interactive web application to perform portfolio optimization using the Sharpe Ratio technique.
- Integrate features for data retrieval, preprocessing, visualization, and optimization to assist investors in making data-driven decisions.

# **_Approach:_**

- **Data Retrieval and Preprocessing:**
  - Fetch historical data for various commodities using APIs and other data sources.
  - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
  - Feature engineering, such as extracting date components and calculating financial metrics.

- **Interactive User Interface:**
  - Implement a navigation bar for seamless user experience.
  - Allow users to select commodities, set data parameters, and visualize the results dynamically.

    <br>
    
- **Portfolio Optimization:**
  - Apply the Sharpe Ratio technique to determine the optimal weights for each commodity in the portfolio.
  - Visualize the optimal portfolio allocation and expected returns using bar plots and pie charts.

# **_Results:_**

- The application provides an intuitive interface for investors to explore commodity data, visualize trends, and optimize their portfolios.
- By utilizing the Sharpe Ratio technique, users can achieve a balanced portfolio with maximized returns and minimized risks.
- The dynamic and interactive visualizations aid in understanding complex data, facilitating better investment decisions.
